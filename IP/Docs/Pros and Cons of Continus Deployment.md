### Pros of Continous Deployment
So what are some points at to look. Because Delivery and Deployment share still quite some few. But there is one point that is already different beteween Delivery and Delpoyment. What is that? Well in Deployment the process is automated up until deployment to the customer. So lets start an look with that subject.

#### Automated process up untill the customer
Continus Deployment takes the process an step further then Continus delivery. The whole process is automated up until the deployment to the customer which is handy for the developers.

With this process all the developers have to do is focus on making software. Ofcourse this is an benefit for the team. Because all they have to focus on is making software and on occasion fix any bugs/issues that come back from the customer 

This is also ofcourse both an benefit and disadvantage for the customer. Well what is the benefit then? Every change is directly availble to the customer.  So the customer can directly see every change made and see what has changed. This also brings an anthor piece of benefit. 

#### Shorten feedbackloop
This benefit is also acctuly something for Continous delivery but is far more seen at this sorts of pipelines. Since everything that has been pushed is directly deployed to an customer. This gives the chance for an customer to quicker give feedback and say what is wrong and has to be changed.

This is also an piece that happends with the CI/CD/CD pipelines. Since if an build/test falis and is not pushed. The pipeline will give an detail report on what went wrong. Which is also handy for developers since they dont have to search to where the bug/issue is. But these Cons are also to be paided with an price.

### Cons of Continous Deployment
With pros there has to be ofcourse some cons right? Well for this 2 subject its acctuly an part of both the con and pro. Let me explain in the subjects below.

#### Expections of the cutsomer and keeping up with it
Ofcourse with the benefit of everything that is made is directly pushed to the customer. Also comes an quite downsight. Over the course of time the customer is going to get used to an Changing envoriment. Why is then an downsight? 

Well over the flow van time there will be an time where you are bug fixing right?. The moment is pushed and changed the customer can expect somthing new. But in reallity your only pushed something small. 

This can lead to an work envoriment where expections has to be held high. Every change has to contain something new. This can in the long run be an negative for the developers. Since it can lead in rare cases to stress and discomfort on the workfloor. 

#### Short feedbackloop 
Thats right also an part of the last subject is the short feedbackloop. Why is it both a pro and a con. The feedback can be both renderd postive and negative. Why do i say this well one its the person who recives and two how it is taken.

First and for most. We humans hate giving negative feedback. Also giving negative feedback its something we dont like. In some cases we turn feedback down or take a stab to heart and look at it. Why do i bring it up. Well feedback here is your greates ali and biggest enemy.

An bunch of feedback session can lead to the fact that the customer thinks that you will take them on every word they say. So turning down an request can lead to dissapointment. Dissapointment can lead to negative effects. Feedback can also be an waste since their maby telling you already that is known within the team.

The rare cases take it an step further. You will come acroos customers who are just very Vocal. This is sometimes quite good but can also be an danager to the team. Only the rarest of rarest cases from an threat for this. 

So yeah there are an dozen reasons why feedback can be either and big Postive or an big Negative. But lets not daydream ahead. Should we look what for effect this CI/CD pipeline has on out architechture.
